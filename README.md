# alexa-pokemon-api
A simple proof of concept that allows you to ask Amazon's Alexa for random Pokemon facts, such as "How tall is Bulbasaur?". Alexa responds verbally and/or via Slack (why not).

Data is retrieved from the PokeAPI. Only a couple endpoints are included in this proof of concept. The Slack integration was just for fun, and requires you to set up "incoming webhooks" on your Slack Team.
